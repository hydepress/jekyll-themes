# Jekyll Themes 'n' Templates (Book Edition)

by Mark Otto, Michael Rose, Tim O'Brien, Elle Kasai, Gerald Bauer, et al


> **Note:** The book edition is still an early release and a work-in-progess.


This is the themes documentation (mostly READMEs)
for the Jekyll static site builder / generator
reformatted in a single-page book edition.

See the [source repo](https://github.com/hydepress/hydepress.github.io) for how
the book gets auto-built with "plain" Jekyll - of course - and
hosted on GitHub Pages.
